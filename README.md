## General Information
- Business Context: Understanding risk analytics in banking and financial services, particularly in the context of loan approval and minimizing financial loss.

- Company Profile: Working for a consumer finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers, where loan approval decisions are crucial for minimizing business loss and financial risk.

- Risk Factors: Two main risks associated with loan decisions: loss of business if a potential borrower who would repay the loan is denied, and financial loss if a borrower defaults on the loan after approval.
